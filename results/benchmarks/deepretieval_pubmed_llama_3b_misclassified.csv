SRX4348502,0,native,LLM,Keyword search skipped (LLM-Only mode),"Native. Cell type class=Blood, Cell type=Natural killer cells, Source name=splenic NK cells, Condition=IFNaIL2 trial"
SRX1495349,0,native,LLM,Keyword search skipped (LLM-Only mode),"Native. Cell type classification and source name indicate a native sample, but the presence of an injury trial (MI) and specific strain (C57BL/6) suggests it's not a standard control sample. However, since it's a heart tissue sample from a controlled trial, it's still considered native."
