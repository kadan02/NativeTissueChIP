TASK: Extract the IDs of **NATIVE** sample sequencings from the provided **DATA**.
The **DATA** consists of ChIP-Seq metadata in TSV format. Each row represents one sequencing, and the **first column contains the sequencing ID**.

### **DEFINITION OF NATIVE SAMPLES**
A **native** sample meets all the following criteria:
- Mimics normal physiological conditions.
- Comes from healthy, unmodified, and drug-free specimens.
- Typically includes **wild-type (WT), untreated, and control samples**, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### **NON-NATIVE INDICATORS**
A sample is **non-native** if it includes **any** of the following:
- **Immortalized cell lines** (e.g., HeLa, HEK293).
- **Keywords** indicating modification or disease, such as:
- `"cancer"`, `"tumor"`, `"treated"`, `"knockout"`, `"fetal"`, `"embryonic"`.
- **Synonyms or abbreviations** of these terms.

### **EXCEPTIONS (NOT NON-NATIVE)**
- Primary or regular human cell lines (e.g., `"ED cells"`) **are NOT** non-native.
- `"Breast cells"` or `"differentiated"` **alone** do not indicate non-native status.

### **RESPONSE FORMAT (STRICTLY JSON)**
**Return only a JSON object, with no additional text.**
The format must be **exactly** as follows:
```json
{"native_ids": ["<id1>", "<id2>"]}
