TASK: Extract the IDs of NATIVE sample sequencings from the DATA.
The DATA consists of ChIP-Seq metadata from a TSV file. Each row is one sequencing. The first column is the id.

DEFINITION OF NATIVE SAMPLES:
- Native samples mimic normal physiological conditions.
- They come from healthy, unmodified, and drug-free specimens.
- Wild-type (WT), untreated, and control samples are usually native; but verify for any non-native indicators.

NON-NATIVE INDICATORS:
- Any immortalized cell line name.
- Keywords such as:
   - 'cancer'
   - 'tumor'
   - 'treated'
   - 'knockout'
   - 'fetal'
   - 'embryonic'
- and any of their synonyms or abbreviations.
Mention of a regular human cell line (e.g., 'ED cells') or primary cell line is NOT a non-native indicator.

IMPORTANT: Return only the JSON object, exactly in the format specified below, with no extra text or formatting.

ANSWER FORMAT:  {"native_ids": ["<id1>", "<id2>"]}
Answer example 1: {"native_ids": []}
Answer example 2: {"native_ids": ["DRX044425", "DRX044426"]}
